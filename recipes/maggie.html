    <h1>Spaghetti Carbonara Recipe</h1>
    <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/14/dining/carbonara-horizontal/carbonara-horizontal-threeByTwoMediumAt2X-v2.jpg">
    <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its rich, creamy 
       texture and bold, savory flavor—all achieved without using any cream. Originating from Rome, this
       traditional recipe combines just a few simple ingredients: eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, pancetta (or guanciale),
       and freshly ground black pepper. The result is a comforting and elegant dish that captures the essence of Italian cooking—simplicity, balance, and quality.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Perfect for both a quick weeknight dinner and an impressive meal for guests, Carbonara relies on technique rather 
        than complexity. The heat of the freshly cooked pasta gently cooks the eggs, creating a luscious sauce that clings 
        to each strand of spaghetti. With each bite, you'll enjoy the salty richness of the pancetta, the sharpness of the 
        cheese, and the subtle warmth of black pepper—an unforgettable combination that's stood the test of time.
    </p>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <Ul>
        <li>200g spaghetti</li>
        <li>100g pancetta (or bacon), diced</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Pecorino Romano (or Parmesan)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic (optional)</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>

    </Ul>
    <br>
    <h2>How to make Spaghetti Carbonara</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta 
            water, then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook until 
            crispy. If using garlic, sauté it with the pancetta and remove it once browned.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and freshly ground 
            black pepper.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat under the pancetta pan. Add the hot, drained spaghetti to the pan and toss 
            well to coat it with the pancetta and its fat.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta and quickly toss everything together. 
            The residual heat from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>Add a bit of the reserved pasta water, if needed, to loosen the sauce to your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with extra cheese and black pepper on top.</li>
